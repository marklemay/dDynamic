  * does not specialize the cases where the type is unique
  * can extend `whnf` with info to track wich vars sould be expanded to "unstick" computations
* needs more testing
  * exampels in CH5 of thesis
  * earier examples
* nested cases need to be turned on and tested
* better warning/error messages
